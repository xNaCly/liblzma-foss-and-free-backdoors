In recent years, several vulnerabilities in the open-source software supply
chain were discovered. The most recent being the intentionally placed backdoor
in the compression library named \textit{liblzma}. This paper aims to explore
the implementation of said backdoor while highlighting the insertion of the
backdoor and the inserters use of social engineering enabling their placement
in the leadership of the project. Furthermore ways of preventing similar
attacks are presented and evaluated on the example of the \textit{liblzma}
situation.
