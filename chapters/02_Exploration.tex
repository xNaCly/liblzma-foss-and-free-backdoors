\section{Backdoor Exploration}

According to \cite{wysopal2007static}, a backdoor refers to a hidden method of
gaining entry to a system bypassing security measures, such as biometric or
password based authentication. They can be implemented in cryptographic
algorithms, on the hardware level or in an application. Backdoors can be used
to remotely access systems and are often hidden inside commonly used
non-malicious software.
